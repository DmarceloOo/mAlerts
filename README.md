mAlerts is a plugin which allows you to broadcast messages in different ways. For now you can only broadcast a message in a normal chat using `/broadcast <message>`. To use this command, a player will need a certain permission which is, `malerts.admin`

Every time a player broadcasts a message, there will be a prefix before the message. That prefix is possible to be changed inside the `config file`.

There is also a command that allows you to reload the config of the plugin. This allows to change things quicker than reloading/restarting your server. The command is called, `/malerts` and it needs the same permission as the first one, `malerts.admin`.
